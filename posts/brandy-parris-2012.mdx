People have written so many wonderful things already. I find myself nodding, laughing, tearing up as I read through and am reminded of what an amazing and lovely person Sam is and how very fortunate we all are to have her in our lives.

Here are some words I can add to this _mista parole fresca_:

Righteousness. Sam is a politically savvy, truly feminist, clear-thinking radical. This is what first drew me to her when I met her at a rooftop party years ago. When it comes to politics and society, she is astonishingly well-informed, appropriately angry, authentically righteous, and unfailingly fair. Sam manages to read widely and regularly about politics, even reading the stuff that makes other less hearty souls (like me) rage too hard to continue reading; somehow, she remains collected enough to read so she can rage even more intelligently.

Genius. Sam is the smartest person I’ve ever met, and I have met a lot of really smart people. She is incredibly voracious and curious. The internet, with its never-ending influx of new information and outrageously large info-linking potential, was clearly made for her. Sam’s mind also has a quality of openness that I deeply admire and that is rare in such super-smart, well-read, hyper-educated people. All of her senses are exquisitely exposed to the world, allowing data and stimuli to stream in and circulate until they begin to eddy in one spot or another, whirling into some new impression, inspiration, insight. If you’re lucky and you’re paying attention, you can drink salubriously of the wisdom that results from this process.

Humor. Sam has this sneaky, intelligent wit that surprises you with odd juxtapositions, clever linguistic twists, or biting insight, all delivered in a laconic, sotto voce style as if this brilliance was really just some scrap of tissue tossed to the wind.

Comfort. Sam is a woman who loves comfort and surrounds herself with comfortable and comforting things: cats, soft grey sweaters, tea, pleasant scents, warmth. My constant image of Sam has her sitting on a well-cushioned couch, her feet tucked up sideways under her, with a cat and a cup of tea close by. She’s wearing dark, buttery, stretchy jeans, a supersoft, wine-colored t-shirt, cozy socks, and a longish, grey merino sweater. And, of course, she smells amazing – in my fantasy, it’s always Bulgari’s Thé Vert. Sam’s love of comfort means spending time with her affords you the chance to absorb and appreciate some of this cozy contentment as well. In fact, simply thinking of Sam is comforting.

Hiccurps. The hiccurp is that abrupt little squeak that sometimes finds its way out of her. It is the cutest, tiniest, daintiest, sweetest “burp” you will ever hear. Although I’m not sure why this is my favorite thing about Sam, I can say that every time I hear it, I am reminded how much I love and cherish her.
